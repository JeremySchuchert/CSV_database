# CSV_database_C (School Project)

## User inputs:
addrow <rowname> - to add a row to the DB <br/>
addcol <colname> - to add a col to the DB <br/>
average <rowname> - to count the AVG of the col <br/>
min <rowname> - to count the MIN of the row that the user typed <br/>
max <rowname> - to count the MAX of the row that the user typed <br/>
sum <rowname> - to count the SUM of the row that the user typed <br/>
exit - exit program

## How the program should look
when starting the program load and print the CSV and under it have what the user can do (User inputs)

## How it should work
when the user puts an intput keep the CSV printed but once the user finishes the input clear the screen and print the updated CSV
